        <h1>ATM website</h1>

        <p class="explanation">The brief for this project was to redesign the website of ATM focusing in particular on the purchasing of the tickets. The site had to be responsive and usable also from the mobile.</p>
        <p class="explanation">The first step was to study the behaviour of the users to understand their mental model and how they approach the purchasing. Starting from that, we drew some personas with specific personalities and needs. For each persona we build a task flow.</p>

        <div class="img atm-personas"></div>

        <div class="img atm-task"></div>

        <p class="explanation">Based on that, we designed a new structure for the site (i.e. adding the possibility to buy a ticket by selecting zones and decide the duration of it through a calendar). Then we started building a new appearence trying to combine an attractive style with a user-friendly interface.</p>

        <div class="img atm-zones"></div>

        <p class="explanation">The next move was to conduct some user-tests through a prototype built in Invision to be sure that every step in the purchasing process was clear and easy for the users. Then the final coded model was built in order to have a usable and responsive website.</p>
