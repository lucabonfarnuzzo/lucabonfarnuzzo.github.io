        <h1>Samsung Contact</h1>

        <p class="explanation">Samsung Contact is a group project done for the SAMSUNG itself, the brand asked to create a digital experience for their customers.
        </p>
        <p class="explanation">After a research about the brand and its products, we tought that the best way to engage customers and make them discover the vast Samsung world was through an arcade based app game. It will entertain the users while teaching them something about the various technology advancement of Samsung products and create a connection with them, that’s why we named our app “Samsung Contact”. The user will be able to use the app everywhere simulating the usage of the products.</p>

        <p class="explanation">The next step was to find a style that would match both: the brand and the arcade games world.</p>

        <div class="img sams-graphics"></div>


        <p class="explanation">Then we started the design
            <br> > The products are divided in 4 families: cleaning / kitchen / living / mobile devices.
            <br> > For each family we’ve selected few products that stand out from Samsung’s competitors for their features.</p>

        <div class="img sams-families"></div>

        <p class="explanation">
            > For each product the user could play an intuitive time based mini-games.
            <br> > For each product there are: 3 levels of difficulty rated from 0 (task failed) to 3 stars each (according to how fast/well the will complete the task).
            <br> > When the user complete all the mini-games of a family with the best score in each level, will be rewarded with a digital prize.</p>

        <div class="img sams-pl"></div>

        <p class="explanation">WW8500 addwash Minigame</p>

        <p class="explanation">
            > frontloader to add laundry in mid-cycle
            <br> > up to 12kg of load
        </p>

        <p class="explanation">
            The user should swipe the clothes in the washing machine in the display till he reaches 12kg and then select the correct program to wash that type of clothes on the real machine. While the the machine is working he will tilt his device to add the forgotten clothes.</p>

        <div class="img sams-game"></div>
        
        <p class="explanation">
            The user could know about the app through different touchpoints:</p>
        
        <div class="img sams-touchpoints"></div>
        
        
        <p class="explanation">
            Instore the user could download the app through a Beacon and play through his phone using the Augmented Reality and at the same time interact with the real products.</p>
